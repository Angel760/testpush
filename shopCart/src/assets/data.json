One goal in collecting personal information from you is to provide an efficient, meaningful, and customized experience. For example, we can use your personal information to:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>\r\n<p>Help make the Site more convenient for you to use by not having to enter information more than once.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li>\r\n<p>Help you quickly find information, products, and services.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li>\r\n<p>Help us create content that is most relevant to you.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li>\r\n<p>Alert you to new information, products, and services that we offer.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>We personally collect identifiable information such as names, postal codes, addresses, emails, phone numbers and so on, which are voluntarily submitted by our visitors like you. The information you provide and that is collected is used to fulfill your order, keep you informed about promotions, competition outcomes or content, such as health tips and recipes, that might interest you. We also use this information to communicate with you on customer service enquiries, returns or any other requests that you may have.</p>\r\n<h4>Cookies / Tracking Technology / Logfiles</h4>\r\n<p>Like many sites, the Site employs cookies and web beacons (also known as clear GIF technology or &ldquo;action tags&rdquo;) to speed up your navigation of the Site, recognize you and your access privileges, and track your Site usage.</p>\r\n<p>Cookies are small pieces of information that are stored as text files by your Internet browser on your computer&rsquo;s hard drive. Most Internet browsers are initially set to accept cookies. You can set your browser to refuse cookies from web sites or to remove cookies from your hard drive, but if you do, you will not be able to access or use portions of the Site. We have to use cookies to enable you to select products, place them in an online shopping cart, and to purchase those products. If you do this, we keep a record of your browsing activity and purchases. THE SITE&rsquo;S COOKIES DO NOT AND CANNOT INFILTRATE A USER&rsquo;S HARD DRIVE TO GATHER A USER&rsquo;S CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION. Our cookies are not \"spyware.\"</p>\r\n<p>Web beacons assist in delivering cookies and help us determine whether a web page on the Site has been viewed and, if so, how many times. For example, any electronic image on the Site, such as an ad banner, can function as a web beacon.</p>\r\n<p>We may use third-party advertising companies to help tailor site content to users or to serve ads on our behalf. These companies may employ cookies and web beacons to measure advertising effectiveness (such as the web pages visited or products purchased and in what amount). Any information that these third parties collect via cookies and web beacons is not linked to any personal information collected by us.</p>\r\n<p>As an example, Facebook collects certain information via cookies and web beacons to determine which web pages are visited or what products are purchased. Please note that any information collected by Facebook via cookies and web beacons is not linked to any customer&rsquo;s personal information collected by us.</p>\r\n<p>Log Files.

We also use this information to improve our Site&rsquo;s layout and content as well as our outreach and own marketing efforts.</p>\r\n<p>We do not sell, rent, trade, license or otherwise disclose your specific personal information or financial information to anyone except in the event of fraud prevention or investigation. In this case we may be asked to share collected information with governmental agencies or other companies assisting us. We may do so when: (1) permitted or required by law; or, (2) trying to protect against or prevent actual or potential fraud or unauthorized transactions; or, (3) investigating fraud which has already taken place. The information is never provided to these companies for marketing purposes.</p>\r\n<h4>Commitment to Data Security</h4>\r\n<p>To protect your personal information, we take reasonable precautions and follow the industry&rsquo;s best practices to make sure it is not inappropriately lost, misused, accessed, disclosed, altered or destroyed.

All credit card details are encrypted through the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI-DSS). All payment gateways adhere to the standards set by PCI-DSS as managed by the PCI Security Standards Council, which is a joint effort of brands like Visa, MasterCard, American Express and Discover. We therefore do not see or keep your credit card information.</p>\r\n<p>While we use industry-standard precautions to safeguard your personal information, we cannot guarantee complete security. 100% complete security does not presently exist anywhere online or offline.</p>\r\n<h4>Optout/Corrections</h4>\r\n<p>If you would like to (a) correct or update your personal information; (b) stop receiving emails to your email address; and/or (c) delete any personal information we have about you (d) register a complaint or (e) require more information please send your request to hello@skinnyfit.com</p>\r\n<h4>Updates to this Policy</h4>\r\n<p>If we change or update this Privacy Policy, we will post changes and updates on the Site so that you will always be aware of what information we collect, use and disclose.

General </strong>Arbitration is a manner of resolving a &ldquo;Claim&rdquo; without filing a lawsuit. &ldquo;Claim&rdquo; means any dispute between you, Skinny Fit, or any involved third party relating to your account, your use of the Website, your relationship with Skinny Fit, these Terms, or the Privacy Policy. This includes any and all claims that relate in any way to your use or attempted use of the products, and any act or omission by Skinny Fit or any third party related to your use or attempted use of the products. You, Skinny Fit, or any involved third party may pursue a Claim. Skinny Fit agrees to final and binding confidential arbitration should it have any Claims against you. Likewise, you agree to final and binding confidential arbitration should you have any Claims against Skinny Fit. By agreeing to arbitrate, you waive the right to go to court and agree instead to submit any Claims to final and binding confidential arbitration. This arbitration provision sets forth the terms and conditions of our agreement to final and binding confidential arbitration and is governed by and enforceable under the Federal Arbitration Act (the &ldquo;FAA&rdquo;), 9 U.S.C. &sect;&sect; 1-16, as amended.</p>\r\n<p><strong>B. Exceptions </strong>Notwithstanding the foregoing, and as an exception to final and binding confidential arbitration, you and Skinny Fit both retain the right to pursue, in small claims court, any claim that is within that court&rsquo;s jurisdiction and proceeds on an individual (non-class) basis, including overdue account matters within the small claims court&rsquo;s jurisdiction. Skinny Fit will not demand arbitration in connection with any individual claim that you properly file and pursue in a small claims court, so long as the claim is and remains pending in that court. The following claims shall not be subject to final and binding arbitration and must be adjudicated only in the state or federal courts located in San Diego, California: (i) any dispute, controversy, or claim relating to the infringement or validity of our proprietary rights, including without limitation, trademarks, service marks, trade dress, copyrights, trade secrets, or patents; or (ii) an action by Skinny Fit for temporary, preliminary, or permanent injunctive relief, whether prohibitive or mandatory, or other provisional relief, against you for breach or threatened breach of this Agreement. You expressly agree to refrain from bringing or joining any claims that are excluded from final and binding arbitration pursuant to this subsection &ldquo;b&rdquo; in any representative or class-wide capacity, including but not limited to bringing or joining any claims in any class action or any class-wide arbitration. Small claims matters may be filed in any small claims court with personal and subject matter jurisdiction over the parties. For all other matters excluded from final and binding arbitration by this subsection &ldquo;b,&rdquo; the parties consent to exclusive jurisdiction and venue in the state and federal courts located in San Diego, California, and forever waive any challenge to said courts&rsquo; jurisdiction and venue.</p>\r\n<p><strong>C. Required Pre-Dispute Procedures </strong>We acknowledge and agree that before initiating any Claim against the other, we agree to first contact the other with a written description of the dispute, which shall include all relevant documents and information, and the proposed resolution. You may send the written description of any dispute you have with us by U.S. Mail to Skinny Fit, LLC, Attn: Shannon Koehler, 530 B Street, Suite 1500, San Diego, CA 92101. Skinny Fit will contact you by letter at the billing address you provided to us or at the email address you provided to us. You agree to negotiate with Skinny Fit or its designated representative in good faith about your problem or dispute. If for some reason the dispute is not resolved within 60 days after receipt of the written dispute, we agree to the dispute resolution provisions below. Notwithstanding the foregoing or any other term of this arbitration agreement, we will have the right to seek injunctive or other equitable relief in state or federal court located in San Diego, California to enforce these Terms or prevent an infringement of a third party&rsquo;s rights or our intellectual property rights, as stated in subsection &ldquo;b&rdquo; above. You hereby expressly consent to, and forever waive any challenge to, the exclusive personal jurisdiction and venue of said courts in such actions.</p>\r\n<p><strong>D. Commencing Arbitration </strong>You and Skinny Fit agree to commence any arbitration proceeding within 1 year after the Claim arises (the 1 year period includes the required pre-dispute procedures set forth above) and that any arbitration proceeding commenced after 1 year shall be forever barred.</p>\r\n<p><strong>E. Arbitration Location </strong>If the amount in controversy is $500 or less, then the arbitration may be conducted by telephone or by written submissions. Otherwise, the arbitration shall be conducted in San Diego, California unless Skinny Fit otherwise agrees to arbitrate in another forum requested by you.</p>\r\n<p><strong>F. Organization, Rules and the Arbitrator </strong>We each agree that any and all Claims other than those exempted under subsection &ldquo;b&rdquo; above shall be submitted to final and binding confidential arbitration before a single arbitrator of the American Arbitration Association (&ldquo;AAA&rdquo;). Either party may commence the arbitration process by submitting a written demand for arbitration with the AAA, and providing a copy to the other party, within the time period set forth in subsection &ldquo;d&rdquo; above. The arbitrator shall be selected by agreement of the parties or, if the parties cannot agree, chosen in accordance with Rules of the AAA. The arbitration will be conducted in accordance with the provisions of the AAA&rsquo;s Commercial Dispute Resolutions Procedures, Supplementary Procedures for Consumer-Related Disputes, in effect at the time of submission of the demand for arbitration. The AAA'S Rules are available at www.adr.org or by calling 1-800-778-7879. The arbitrator shall have the exclusive and sole authority to resolve any dispute relating to the interpretation, construction, validity, applicability, or enforceability of these Terms, the Privacy Policy, and this arbitration provision. The arbitrator shall have the exclusive and sole authority to determine whether any dispute is arbitrable. The arbitrator shall have the exclusive and sole authority to determine whether this arbitration agreement can be enforced against a non-signatory to this agreement and whether a non-signatory to this agreement can enforce this provision against you or Skinny Fit.</p>\r\n<p><strong>G. Fees </strong>Payment of all filing, administration and arbitrator fees will be governed by the AAA&rsquo;s Rules. We will reimburse the fees charged by the arbitrator for claims totaling less than $10,000 unless the arbitrator determines the claims are frivolous. Likewise, we will not seek attorneys&rsquo; fees and costs in arbitration unless the arbitrator determines the claims are frivolous. In all other respects, the parties shall each pay their own additional fees, costs, and expenses, including, but not limited to, those for any attorneys, experts, documents, and witnesses.</p>\r\n<p><strong>H. Governing Law and Award </strong>The arbitrator shall follow the substantive law of the State of California without regard to its conflicts of laws principles. Any award rendered shall include a confidential written opinion and shall be final, subject to appeal under the FAA. Judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction.</p>\r\n<p><strong>I. Enforceability </strong>This provision survives termination of your account or relationship with Skinny Fit, bankruptcy, assignment, or transfer. If the class action waiver is deemed unenforceable (i.e., unenforceability would allow arbitration to proceed as a class or representative action), then this entire arbitration provision shall be rendered null and void and shall not apply. If a portion of this arbitration provision (other than the class action waiver) is deemed unenforceable, the remaining portions of this arbitration provision shall remain in full force and effect.</p>\r\n<p><strong>J. Miscellaneous </strong>Failure or any delay in enforcing this arbitration provision in connection with any particular Claim will not constitute a waiver of any rights to require arbitration at a later time or in connection with any other Claims except all Claims must be brought within the 1 year limitation period set forth above. This provision is the entire arbitration agreement between you and Skinny Fit and shall not be modified except in writing by Skinny Fit.</p>\r\n<p><strong>K.
